"The tutorial illustrates the generic launcher class :class:`akka.Main` "
"which expects only one command line argument: the class name of the "
"applicationâ€™s main actor. This main method will then create the "
"infrastructure needed for running the actors, start the given main actor "
"and arrange for the whole application to shut down once the main actor "
"terminates."
