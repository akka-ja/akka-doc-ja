"Akka HTTP is streaming *all the way through*, which means that the back-"
"pressure mechanisms enabled by Akka Streams are exposed through all "
"layers–from the TCP layer, through the HTTP server, all the way up to the"

"This has suprising implications if you are used to non-streaming / not-"
"reactive HTTP clients. Specifically it means that: \"*lack of consumption"
" of the HTTP Entity, is signaled as back-pressure to the other side of "
"the connection*\". This is a feature, as it allows one only to consume "
"the entity, and back-pressure servers/clients from overwhelming our "
"application, possibly causing un-necessary buffering of the entity in "
"memory."

"Consuming (or discarding) the Entity of a request is mandatory! If "
"*accidentally* left neither consumed or discarded Akka HTTP will asume "

"The most common use-case of course is consuming the response entity, "

"It is encouraged to use various streaming techniques to utilise the "

"however sometimes the need may arise to consume the entire entity as "

" Akka HTTP provides a special ``toStrict(timeout)`` method which can be "

"Sometimes when calling HTTP services we do not care about their response "

"The ``discardEntityBytes`` convenience method serves the purpose of "

"Similarily as with the Client-side, HTTP Entities are directly linked to "
"Streams which are fed by the underlying TCP connection. Thus, if request "
"entities remain not consumed, the server will back-pressure the "

"A related concept is *cancelling* the incoming ``entity.dataBytes`` "
"stream, which results in Akka HTTP *abruptly closing the connection from "
"the Client*. This may be useful when you detect that the given user "
"should not be allowed to make any uploads at all, and you want to drop "
"the connection (instead of reading and ignoring the incoming data). This "
"can be done by attaching the incoming ``entity.dataBytes`` to a "
"``Sink.cancelled`` which will cancel the entity stream, which in turn "
"will cause the underlying connection to be shut-down by the server – "
"effectively hard-aborting the incoming request:"
