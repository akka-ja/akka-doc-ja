"The ``rejectEmptyResponse`` directive is mostly used with marshalling "
"``Option[T]`` instances. The value ``None`` is usually marshalled to an "
"empty but successful result. In many cases ``None`` should instead be "
"handled as ``404 Not Found`` which is the effect of using "
"``rejectEmptyResponse``."
