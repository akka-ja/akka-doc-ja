"Checks whether the unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` has a suffix "
"matched by the given ``PathMatcher``. Potentially extracts one or more "
"values (depending on the type of the argument) but doesn't consume its match"
" from the unmatched path."

"This directive is very similar to the :ref:`-pathSuffix-` directive with the"
" one difference that the path suffix it matched (if it matched) is *not* "
"consumed. The unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` is therefore left as "
"is even in the case that the directive successfully matched and the request "
"is passed on to its inner route."

"For efficiency reasons, the given ``PathMatcher`` must match the desired "
