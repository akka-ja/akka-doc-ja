"Please note that setting handler is inherently racy as the timeout is "
"measured from starting to handle the request to its deadline, thus if the"

"would have emitted the default timeout HttpResponse."

"In practice this can only be a problem with very tight timeouts, so with "
"default settings of request timeouts being measured in seconds it "
"shouldn't be a problem in reality (though certainly a possibility still)."
