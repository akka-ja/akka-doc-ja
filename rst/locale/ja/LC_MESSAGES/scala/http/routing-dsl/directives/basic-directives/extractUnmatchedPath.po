"The ``extractUnmatchedPath`` directive extracts the remaining path that "
"was not yet matched by any of the :ref:`PathDirectives` (or any custom "
"ones that change the unmatched path field of the request context). You "
"can use it for building directives that handle complete suffixes of paths"
" (like the ``getFromDirectory`` directives and similar ones)."
