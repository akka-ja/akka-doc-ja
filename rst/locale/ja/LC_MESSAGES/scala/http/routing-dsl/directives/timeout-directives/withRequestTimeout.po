"The timeout can be either loosened or made more tight using this directive, "
"however one should be aware that it is inherently racy (which may especially"
" show with very tight timeouts) since a timeout may already have been "
"triggered when this directive executes."

"In case of pipelined HTTP requests (multiple requests being accepted on the "
"same connection before sending the first response) a the request timeout "
"failure of the ``n-th`` request *will shut down the connection* causing the "
"already enqueued requests to be dropped. This is by-design, as the request "
"timeout feature serves as a \"safety net\" in case of programming errors "
"(e.g. a Future that never completes thus potentially blocking the entire "
"connection forever) or malicious attacks on the server."

"Optionally, a timeout handler may be provided in which is called when a "
"time-out is triggered and must produce an ``HttpResponse`` that will be sent"
" back to the client instead of the \"too late\" response (in case it'd ever "
"arrive). See also :ref:`-withRequestTimeoutResponse-` if only looking to "
"customise the timeout response without changing the timeout itself."

"Please note that setting the timeout from within a directive is inherently "
"racy (as the \"point in time from which we're measuring the timeout\" is "
"already in the past (the moment we started handling the request), so if the "
"existing timeout already was triggered before your directive had the chance "
"to change it, an timeout may still be logged."

"It is recommended to use a larger statically configured timeout (think of it"
