"The user-defined authorization check can either be supplied as a ``=> "
"Boolean`` value which is calculated just from information out of the lexical"
" scope, or as a function ``RequestContext => Boolean`` which can also take "
"information from the request itself into account."

msgid ""
"If the check returns ``true`` the request is passed on to the inner route "
"unchanged, otherwise an ``AuthorizationFailedRejection`` is created, "
"triggering a ``403 Forbidden`` response by default (the same as in the case "
"of an ``AuthenticationFailedRejection``)."

"In a common use-case you would check if a user (e.g. supplied by any of the "
"``authenticate*`` family of directives, e.g. :ref:`-authenticateBasic-`) is "
"allowed to access the inner routes, e.g. by checking if the user has the "
"needed permissions."
