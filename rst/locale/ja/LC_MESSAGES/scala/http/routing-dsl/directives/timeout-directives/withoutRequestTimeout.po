"Please note that setting the timeout from within a directive is "
"inherently racy (as the \"point in time from which we're measuring the "
"timeout\" is already in the past (the moment we started handling the "
"request), so if the existing timeout already was triggered before your "
"directive had the chance to change it, an timeout may still be logged."
