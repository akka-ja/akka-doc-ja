"This directive filters the incoming request by its HTTP method. Only "
"requests with method ``HEAD`` are passed on to the inner route. All "
"others are rejected with a ``MethodRejection``, which is translated into "
"a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` response by the default "
":ref:`RejectionHandler <The RejectionHandler>`."

"By default, akka-http handles HEAD-requests transparently by dispatching "
"a GET-request to the handler and stripping of the result body. See the "
"``akka.http.server.transparent-head-requests`` setting for how to disable"
" this behavior."
