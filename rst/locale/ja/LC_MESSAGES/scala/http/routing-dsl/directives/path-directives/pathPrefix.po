"Matches and consumes a prefix of the unmatched path of the "

"This directive filters incoming requests based on the part of their URI that"
" hasn't been matched yet by other potentially existing ``pathPrefix`` or "
":ref:`-rawPathPrefix-` directives on higher levels of the routing structure."
" Its one parameter is usually an expression evaluating to a ``PathMatcher`` "
"instance (see also: :ref:`pathmatcher-dsl`)."

"As opposed to its :ref:`-rawPathPrefix-` counterpart ``pathPrefix`` "
"automatically adds a leading slash to its ``PathMatcher`` argument, you "
"therefore don't have to start your matching expression with an explicit "
"slash."

"Depending on the type of its ``PathMatcher`` argument the ``pathPrefix`` "
"directive extracts zero or more values from the URI. If the match fails the "
"request is rejected with an :ref:`empty rejection set <empty rejections>`."

"The empty string (also called empty word or identity) is a **neutral "
"element** of string concatenation operation, so it will match everything and"
