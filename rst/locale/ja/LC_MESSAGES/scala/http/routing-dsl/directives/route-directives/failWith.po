"Bubbles up the given error through the route structure where it is dealt "
"with by the closest ``handleExceptions`` directive and its "
":class:`ExceptionHandler`."

msgid ""
"``failWith`` explicitly raises an exception that gets bubbled up through the"
" route structure to be picked up by the nearest ``handleExceptions`` "
"directive. Using ``failWith`` rather than simply throwing an exception "
"enables the route structure's :ref:`exception-handling-scala` mechanism to "
"deal with the exception even if the current route is executed asynchronously"
" on another thread (e.g. in a ``Future`` or separate actor)."

msgid ""
"If no ``handleExceptions`` is present above the respective location in the "
"route structure the top-level routing logic will handle the exception and "
"translate it into a corresponding ``HttpResponse`` using the in-scope "
"``ExceptionHandler`` (see also the :ref:`exception-handling-scala` chapter)."

"There is one notable special case: If the given exception is a "
"``RejectionError`` exception it is *not* bubbled up, but rather the wrapped "
"exception is unpacked and \"executed\". This allows the \"tunneling\" of a "
"rejection via an exception."
