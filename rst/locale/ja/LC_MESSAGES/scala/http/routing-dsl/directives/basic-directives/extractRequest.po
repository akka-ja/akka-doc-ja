"Use ``extractRequest`` to extract just the complete URI of the request. "
"Usually there's little use of extracting the complete request because "
"extracting of most of the aspects of HttpRequests is handled by specialized "
"directives. See :ref:`Request Directives`."

"リクエストの完全なURIだけを抽出するには `` extractRequest``を使います。 "
"通常、HttpRequestのほとんどの部分の抽出は特殊なディレクティブによって処理されるため、完全なリクエストを抽出することはほとんどありません。 "
