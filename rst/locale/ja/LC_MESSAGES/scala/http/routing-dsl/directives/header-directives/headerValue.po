"The :ref:`-headerValue-` directive is a mixture of ``map`` and ``find`` "
"on the list of request headers. The specified function is called once for"
" each header until the function returns ``Some(value)``. This value is "
"extracted and presented to the inner route. If the function throws an "
"exception the request is rejected with a ``MalformedHeaderRejection``. If"
" the function returns ``None`` for every header the request is rejected "
"as \"NotFound\"."
