"The :ref:`-headerValue-` directive is a mixture of ``map`` and ``find`` on "
"the list of request headers. The specified function is called once for each "
"header until the function returns ``Some(value)``. This value is extracted "
"and presented to the inner route. If the function throws an exception the "
"request is rejected with a ``MalformedHeaderRejection``. If the function "
"returns ``None`` for every header the request is rejected as \"NotFound\"."
