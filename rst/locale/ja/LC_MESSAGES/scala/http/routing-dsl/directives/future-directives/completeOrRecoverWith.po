"If the ``Future[T]`` succeeds the request is completed using the value's "
"marshaller (this directive therefore requires a marshaller for the future's "
"parameter type to be implicitly available). The execution of the inner route"

"with a failure, exposing the reason of failure as an extraction of type "
"``Throwable``."
