"If the ``Future[T]`` succeeds the request is completed using the value's "
"marshaller (this directive therefore requires a marshaller for the "
"future's parameter type to be implicitly available). The execution of the"
" inner route passed to this directive is only executed if the given "
"future completed with a failure, exposing the reason of failure as an "
"extraction of type ``Throwable``."
