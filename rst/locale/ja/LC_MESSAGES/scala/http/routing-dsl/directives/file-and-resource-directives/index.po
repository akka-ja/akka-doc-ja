"Like the :ref:`RouteDirectives` the ``FileAndResourceDirectives`` are "
"somewhat special in akka-http's routing DSL. Contrary to all other "
"directives they do not produce instances of type ``Directive[L <: "
"HList]`` but rather \"plain\" routes of type ``Route``. The reason is "
"that they are not meant for wrapping an inner route (like most other "
"directives, as intermediate-level elements of a route structure, do) but "
"rather form the actual route structure **leaves**."

"So in most cases the inner-most element of a route structure branch is "
