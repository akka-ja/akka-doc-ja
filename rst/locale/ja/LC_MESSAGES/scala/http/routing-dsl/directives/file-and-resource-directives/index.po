"Like the :ref:`RouteDirectives` the ``FileAndResourceDirectives`` are "
"somewhat special in akka-http's routing DSL. Contrary to all other "
"directives they do not produce instances of type ``Directive[L <: HList]`` "
"but rather \"plain\" routes of type ``Route``. The reason is that they are "
"not meant for wrapping an inner route (like most other directives, as "
"intermediate-level elements of a route structure, do) but rather form the "
"actual route structure **leaves**."

"So in most cases the inner-most element of a route structure branch is one "
"of the :ref:`RouteDirectives` or ``FileAndResourceDirectives``."
