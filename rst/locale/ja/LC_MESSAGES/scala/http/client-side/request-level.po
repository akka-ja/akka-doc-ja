msgid ""
"The request-level API is the most convenient way of using Akka HTTP's "
"client-side functionality. It internally builds upon the :ref:`host-"
"level-api` to provide you with a simple and easy-to-use way of retrieving"
" HTTP responses from remote servers. Depending on your preference you can"
" pick the flow-based or the future-based variant."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:11
msgid ""
"It is recommended to first read the :ref:`implications-of-streaming-http-"
"entities` section, as it explains the underlying full-stack streaming "
"concepts, which may be unexpected when coming from a background with "
"non-\"streaming first\" HTTP Clients."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:16
msgid ""
"The request-level API is implemented on top of a connection pool that is "
"shared inside the ActorSystem. A consequence of using a pool is that "
"long-running requests block a connection while running and starve other "
"requests. Make sure not to use the request-level API for long-running "
"requests like long-polling GET requests. Use the :ref:`connection-level-"
"api` instead."

msgid "Flow-Based Variant"
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:23
msgid ""
"The flow-based variant of the request-level client-side API is presented "
"by the ``Http().superPool(...)`` method. It creates a new \"super "
"connection pool flow\", which routes incoming requests to a (cached) host"
" connection pool depending on their respective effective URIs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:27
msgid ""
"The ``Flow`` returned by ``Http().superPool(...)`` is very similar to the"
" one from the :ref:`host-level-api`, so the :ref:`using-a-host-"
"connection-pool` section also applies here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:30
msgid ""
"However, there is one notable difference between a \"host connection pool"
" client flow\" for the host-level API and a \"super-pool flow\": Since in"
" the former case the flow has an implicit target host context the "
"requests it takes don't need to have absolute URIs or a valid ``Host`` "
"header. The host connection pool will automatically add a ``Host`` header"
" if required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:35
msgid ""
"For a super-pool flow this is not the case. All requests to a super-pool "
"must either have an absolute URI or a valid ``Host`` header, because "
"otherwise it'd be impossible to find out which target endpoint to direct "
"the request to."

msgid ""
"Sometimes your HTTP client needs are very basic. You simply need the HTTP"
" response for a certain request and don't want to bother with setting up "
"a full-blown streaming infrastructure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:45
msgid ""
"For these cases Akka HTTP offers the ``Http().singleRequest(...)`` "
"method, which simply turns an ``HttpRequest`` instance into "
"``Future[HttpResponse]``. Internally the request is dispatched across the"
" (cached) host connection pool for the request's effective URI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:49
msgid ""
"Just like in the case of the super-pool flow described above the request "
"must have either an absolute URI or a valid ``Host`` header, otherwise "
"the returned future will be completed with an error."

msgid "Using the Future-Based API in Actors"
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:54
msgid ""
"When using the ``Future`` based API from inside an ``Actor``, all the "
"usual caveats apply to how one should deal with the futures completion. "
"For example you should not access the Actors state from within the "
"Future's callbacks (such as ``map``, ``onComplete``, ...) and instead you"
" should use the ``pipeTo`` pattern to pipe the result back to the Actor "
"as a message."

"Be sure to consume the response entities "
"``dataBytes:Source[ByteString,Unit]`` by for example connecting it to a "
"``Sink`` (for example ``response.entity.dataBytes.runWith(Sink.ignore)`` "
"if you don't care about the response entity), since otherwise Akka HTTP "
"(and the underlying Streams infrastructure) will understand the lack of "
"entity consumption as a back-pressure signal and stop reading from the "
"underlying TCP connection!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a feature of Akka HTTP that allows consuming entities (and "
"pulling them through the network) in a streaming fashion, and only *on "
"demand* when the client is ready to consume the bytes - it may be a bit "
"suprising at first though."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scala/http/client-side/request-level.rst:79
msgid ""
"There are tickets open about automatically dropping entities if not "
"consumed (`#18716`_ and `#18540`_), so these may be implemented in the "
"near future."
