"Akka HTTP comes with a variety of built-in timeout mechanisms to protect "
"your servers from malicious attacks or programming mistakes. Some of "
"these are simply configuration options (which may be overriden in code) "
"while others are left to the streaming APIs and are easily implementable "
"as patterns in user-code directly."

"Request timeouts are a mechanism that limits the maximum time it may take"
