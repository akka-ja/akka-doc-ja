"HTTP and related specifications define a great number of concepts and "
"functionality that is not specific to either HTTP's client- or server-side "
"since they are meaningful on both end of an HTTP connection. The "
"documentation for their counterparts in Akka HTTP lives in this section "
"rather than in the ones for the :ref:`Client-Side API <http-client-side>`, "
":ref:`http-low-level-server-side-api` or :ref:`http-high-level-server-side-"
"api`, which are specific to one side only."
