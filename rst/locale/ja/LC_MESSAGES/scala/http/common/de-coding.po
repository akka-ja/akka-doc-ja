"The `HTTP spec`_ defines a ``Content-Encoding`` header, which signifies "
"whether the entity body of an HTTP message is \"encoded\" and, if so, by "
"which algorithm. The only commonly used content encodings are compression"
" algorithms."

"Currently Akka HTTP supports the compression and decompression of HTTP "
"requests and responses with the ``gzip`` or ``deflate`` encodings. The "
"core logic for this lives in the `akka.http.scaladsl.coding`_ package."

"The support is not enabled automatically, but must be explicitly "
