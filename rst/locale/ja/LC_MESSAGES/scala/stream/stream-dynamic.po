"A ``KillSwitch`` allows the completion of graphs of ``FlowShape`` from "
"the outside. It consists of a flow element that can be linked to a graph "
"of ``FlowShape`` needing completion control. The ``KillSwitch`` trait "
"allows to complete or fail the graph(s)."

"After the first call to either ``shutdown`` or ``abort``, all subsequent "
