"`Eventsourced`_ and Akka :ref:`persistence-scala` share many high-level "

"This migration guide is more a higher-level comparison of Eventsourced "
"and Akka Persistence rather than a sequence of low-level instructions how"
" to transform Eventsourced application code into Akka Persistence "
"application code. This should provide a good starting point for a "
