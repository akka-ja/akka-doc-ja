"A new :ref:`persistence plugin proxy<persistence-plugin-proxy>` was added, "
"that allows sharing of an otherwise non-sharable journal or snapshot store. "
"The proxy is available by setting ``akka.persistence.journal.plugin`` or "
"``akka.persistence.snapshot-store.plugin`` to "
"``akka.persistence.journal.proxy`` or ``akka.persistence.snapshot-"
"store.proxy``, respectively. The proxy supplants the :ref:`Shared LevelDB "
"journal<shared-leveldb-journal>`."
