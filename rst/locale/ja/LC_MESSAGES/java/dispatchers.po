"An Akka ``MessageDispatcher`` is what makes Akka Actors \"tick\", it is "
"the engine of the machine so to speak. All ``MessageDispatcher`` "
"implementations are also an ``ExecutionContext``, which means that they "

"Every ``ActorSystem`` will have a default dispatcher that will be used in"
" case nothing else is configured for an ``Actor``. The default dispatcher"
" can be configured, and is by default a ``Dispatcher`` with the specified"
" ``default-executor``. If an ActorSystem is created with an "
"ExecutionContext passed in, this ExecutionContext will be used as the "
"default executor for all dispatchers in this ActorSystem. If no "
"ExecutionContext is given, it will fallback to the executor specified in "
"``akka.actor.default-dispatcher.default-executor.fallback``. By default "
"this is a \"fork-join-executor\", which gives excellent performance in "
"most cases."
