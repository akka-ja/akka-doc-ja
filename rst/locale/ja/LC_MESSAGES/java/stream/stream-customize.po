"While the processing vocabulary of Akka Streams is quite rich (see the "
":ref:`stream-cookbook-java` for examples) it is sometimes necessary to "
"define new transformation stages either because some functionality is "
"missing from the stock operations, or for performance reasons. In this "
"part we show how to build custom processing stages and graph junctions of"
" various kinds."

"A custom graph stage should not be the first tool you reach for, defining"
" graphs using flows and the graph DSL is in general easier and does to a "

"The :class:`GraphStage` abstraction can be used to create arbitrary graph"
" processing stages with any number of input or output ports. It is a "
"counterpart of the ``GraphDSL.create()`` method which creates new stream "
"processing stages by composing  others. Where :class:`GraphStage` differs"
" is that it creates a stage that is itself not divisible into smaller "
"ones, and allows state to be maintained inside it in a safe way."

"As a first motivating example, we will build a new :class:`Source` that "
"will simply emit numbers from 1 until it is cancelled. To start, we need "
"to define the \"interface\" of our stage, which is called *shape* in Akka"
" Streams terminology (this is explained in more detail in the section "
":ref:`composition-java`)."

"As you see, in itself the :class:`GraphStage` only defines the ports of "
"this stage and a shape that contains the ports. It also has a user "
"implemented method called ``createLogic``. If you recall, stages are "
"reusable in multiple materializations, each resulting in a different "
"executing entity. In the case of :class:`GraphStage` the actual running "
"logic is modeled as an instance of a :class:`GraphStageLogic` which will "
"be created by the materializer by calling the ``createLogic`` method. In "
"other words, all we need to do is to create a suitable logic that will "
"emit the numbers we want."

"In order to emit from a :class:`Source` in a backpressured stream one "
"needs first to have demand from downstream. To receive the necessary "
"events one needs to register a subclass of :class:`AbstractOutHandler` "
"with the output port (:class:`Outlet`). This handler will receive events "
"related to the lifecycle of the port. In our case we need to override "
"``onPull()`` which indicates that we are free to emit a single element. "
"There is another callback, ``onDownstreamFinish()`` which is called if "
"the downstream cancelled. Since the default behavior of that callback is "
"to stop the stage, we don't need to override it. In the ``onPull`` "
"callback we simply emit the next number."

"Instances of the above :class:`GraphStage` are subclasses of "

"Similarly, to create a custom :class:`Sink` one can register a subclass "

"It is **not safe** to access the state of any custom stage outside of the"
" callbacks that it provides, just like it is unsafe to access the state "
"of an actor from the outside. This means that Future callbacks should "
"**not close over** internal state of custom stages because such access "
"can be concurrent with the provided callbacks, leading to undefined "
"behavior."
