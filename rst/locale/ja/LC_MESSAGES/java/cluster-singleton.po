"Using a singleton should not be the first design choice. It has several "
"drawbacks, such as single-point of bottleneck. Single-point of failure is"
" also a relevant concern, but for some cases this feature takes care of "
"that by making sure that another singleton instance will eventually be "
"started."

"The cluster singleton pattern is implemented by "
"``akka.cluster.singleton.ClusterSingletonManager``. It manages one "
"singleton actor instance among all cluster nodes or a group of nodes "
"tagged with a specific role. ``ClusterSingletonManager`` is an actor that"
" is supposed to be started on all nodes, or all nodes with specified "
"role, in the cluster. The actual singleton actor is started by the "
"``ClusterSingletonManager`` on the oldest node by creating a child actor "
"from supplied ``Props``. ``ClusterSingletonManager`` makes sure that at "
"most one singleton instance is running at any point in time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../java/cluster-singleton.rst:30
msgid ""
"The singleton actor is always running on the oldest member with specified"
" role. The oldest member is determined by "
"``akka.cluster.Member#isOlderThan``. This can change when removing that "
"member from the cluster. Be aware that there is a short time period when "
"there is no active singleton during the hand-over process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../java/cluster-singleton.rst:35
msgid ""
"The cluster failure detector will notice when oldest node becomes "
"unreachable due to things like JVM crash, hard shut down, or network "
"failure. Then a new oldest node will take over and a new singleton actor "
"is created. For these failure scenarios there will not be a graceful "
"hand-over, but more than one active singletons is prevented by all "
"reasonable means. Some corner cases are eventually resolved by "
"configurable timeouts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../java/cluster-singleton.rst:41
msgid ""
"You can access the singleton actor by using the provided "
"``akka.cluster.singleton.ClusterSingletonProxy``, which will route all "
"messages to the current instance of the singleton. The proxy will keep "
"track of the oldest node in the cluster and resolve the singleton's "
"``ActorRef`` by explicitly sending the singleton's ``actorSelection`` the"
" ``akka.actor.Identify`` message and waiting for it to reply. This is "
"performed periodically if the singleton doesn't reply within a certain "
"(configurable) time. Given the implementation, there might be periods of "
"time during which the ``ActorRef`` is unavailable, e.g., when a node "
"leaves the cluster. In these cases, the proxy will buffer the messages "
"sent to the singleton and then deliver them when the singleton is finally"
" available. If the buffer is full the ``ClusterSingletonProxy`` will drop"
" old messages when new messages are sent via the proxy. The size of the "
"buffer is configurable and it can be disabled by using a buffer size of "
"0."

#: ../../java/cluster-singleton.rst:52
msgid ""
"It's worth noting that messages can always be lost because of the "
"distributed nature of these actors. As always, additional logic should be"
" implemented in the singleton (acknowledgement) and in the client (retry)"
" actors to ensure at-least-once message delivery."

"you can not rely on the cluster singleton to be *non-stop* available — "
"e.g. when the node on which the singleton has been running dies, it will "
"take a few seconds for this to be noticed and the singleton be migrated "
"to another node,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../java/cluster-singleton.rst:67
msgid ""
"in the case of a *network partition* appearing in a Cluster that is using"
" Automatic Downing  (see docs for :ref:`automatic-vs-manual-downing-"
"java`), it may happen that the isolated clusters each decide to spin up "
"their own singleton, meaning that there might be multiple singletons "
"running in the system, yet the Clusters have no way of finding out about "
"them (because of the partition)."

"Especially the last point is something you should be aware of — in "
"general when using the Cluster Singleton pattern you should take care of "

"**Be very careful when using Cluster Singleton together with Automatic "
"Downing**, since it allows the cluster to split up into two separate "

"Assume that we need one single entry point to an external system. An "
