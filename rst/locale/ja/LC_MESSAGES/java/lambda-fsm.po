#: ../../java/lambda-fsm.rst:82
msgid ""
"In this case, we start out in the ``Idle`` and ``Uninitialized`` state, "
"where only the ``SetTarget()`` message is handled; ``stay`` prepares to end "
"this event’s processing for not leaving the current state, while the "
"``using`` modifier makes the FSM replace the internal state (which is "
"``Uninitialized`` at this point) with a fresh ``Todo()`` object containing "
"the target actor reference. The ``Active`` state has a state timeout "
"declared, which means that if no message is received for 1 second, a "
"``FSM.StateTimeout`` message will be generated. This has the same effect as "
"receiving the ``Flush`` command in this case, namely to transition back into"
" the ``Idle`` state and resetting the internal queue to the empty vector. "
"But how do messages get queued? Since this shall work identically in both "
"states, we make use of the fact that any event which is not handled by the "
"``when()`` block is passed to the ``whenUnhandled()`` block:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first case handled here is adding ``Queue()`` requests to the internal "

"staying in the ``Active`` state if already there), but only if the FSM data "
"are not ``Uninitialized`` when the ``Queue()`` event is received. "
"Otherwise—and in all other non-handled cases—the second case just logs a "
