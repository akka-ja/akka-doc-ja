"If you want to add features to Akka, there is a very elegant, but "
"powerful mechanism for doing so. It's called Akka Extensions and is "
"comprised of 2 basic components: an ``Extension`` and an ``ExtensionId``."

"Extensions will only be loaded once per ``ActorSystem``, which will be "
"managed by Akka. You can choose to have your Extension loaded on-demand "
"or at ``ActorSystem`` creation time through the Akka configuration. "
"Details on how to make that happens are below, in the \"Loading from "
"Configuration\" section."

"Since an extension is a way to hook into Akka itself, the implementor of "

"To be able to load extensions from your Akka configuration you must add "

"As there is no way to selectively remove such extensions, it should be "
"used with care and only when there is no case where the user would ever "
"want it disabled or have specific support for disabling such sub-"
"features. One example where this could be important is in tests."

"The``akka.library-extensions`` must never be assigned (``= "
