"Checks whether the unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` has a suffix "
"matched by the given ``PathMatcher``. Potentially extracts one or more "
"values (depending on the type of the argument) but doesn't consume its match"
" from the unmatched path."

"This directive is very similar to the :ref:`-pathSuffix-java-` directive "
"with the one difference that the path suffix it matched (if it matched) is "
"*not* consumed. The unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` is therefore "
"left as is even in the case that the directive successfully matched and the "
"request is passed on to its inner route."

"As opposed to :ref:`-pathPrefixTest-java-` this directive matches and "

"For efficiency reasons, the given ``PathMatcher`` must match the desired "
"suffix in reversed-segment order, i.e. ``pathSuffixTest(\"baz\" / \"bar\")``"
" would match ``/foo/bar/baz``! The order within a segment match is not "
"reversed."
