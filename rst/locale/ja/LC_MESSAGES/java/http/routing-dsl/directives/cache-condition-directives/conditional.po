"Depending on the given ``eTag`` and ``lastModified`` values this directive "
"immediately responds with ``304 Not Modified`` or ``412 Precondition "
"Failed`` (without calling its inner route) if the request comes with the "
"respective conditional headers. Otherwise the request is simply passed on to"
" its inner route."

"Since this directive requires the ``EntityTag`` and ``lastModified`` time "
"stamp for the resource as concrete arguments it is usually used quite deep "
"down in the route structure (i.e. close to the leaf-level), where the exact "
"resource targeted by the request has already been established and the "
"respective ETag/Last-Modified values can be determined."
