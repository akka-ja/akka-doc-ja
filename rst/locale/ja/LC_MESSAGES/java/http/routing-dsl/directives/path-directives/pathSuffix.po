"This directive filters incoming requests based on the part of their URI that"
" hasn't been matched yet by other potentially existing path matching "
"directives on higher levels of the routing structure. Its one parameter is "
"usually an expression evaluating to a ``PathMatcher`` instance (see also: "
":ref:`pathmatcher-dsl`)."

"For efficiency reasons, the given ``PathMatcher`` must match the desired "
"suffix in reversed-segment order, i.e. ``pathSuffix(\"baz\" / \"bar\")`` "
"would match ``/foo/bar/baz``! The order within a segment match is not "
"reversed."

"Depending on the type of its ``PathMatcher`` argument the ``pathPrefix`` "
"directive extracts zero or more values from the URI. If the match fails the "
"request is rejected with an :ref:`empty rejection set <empty rejections>`."
