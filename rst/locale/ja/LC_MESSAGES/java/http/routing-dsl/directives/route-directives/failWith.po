"Bubbles up the given error through the route structure where it is dealt "
"with by the closest ``handleExceptions`` directive and its "
":class:`ExceptionHandler`."

"``failWith`` explicitly raises an exception that gets bubbled up through "
"the route structure to be picked up by the nearest ``handleExceptions`` "
"directive. Using ``failWith`` rather than simply throwing an exception "
"enables the route structure's :ref:`exception-handling-java` mechanism to"
" deal with the exception even if the current route is executed "
"asynchronously on another thread (e.g. in a ``Future`` or separate "
"actor)."

"If no ``handleExceptions`` is present above the respective location in "
"the route structure the top-level routing logic will handle the exception"
" and translate it into a corresponding ``HttpResponse`` using the in-"
"scope ``ExceptionHandler`` (see also the :ref:`exception-handling-java` "
"chapter)."

"There is one notable special case: If the given exception is a "
"``RejectionError`` exception it is *not* bubbled up, but rather the "
"wrapped exception is unpacked and \"executed\". This allows the "
"\"tunneling\" of a rejection via an exception."
