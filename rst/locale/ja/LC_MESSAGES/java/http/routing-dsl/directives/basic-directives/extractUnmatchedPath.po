"The ``extractUnmatchedPath`` directive extracts the remaining path that was "
"not yet matched by any of the :ref:`PathDirectives-java` (or any custom ones"
" that change the unmatched path field of the request context). You can use "
"it for building directives that handle complete suffixes of paths (like the "
"``getFromDirectory`` directives and similar ones)."
