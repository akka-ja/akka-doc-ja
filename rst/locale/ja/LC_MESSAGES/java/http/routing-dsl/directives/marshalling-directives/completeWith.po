"Uses the marshaller for a given type to produce a completion function "
"that is passed to its inner route.  You can use it to decouple marshaller"
" resolution from request completion."

"The ``completeWith`` directive works in conjuction with ``instanceOf`` "
"and ``spray.httpx.marshalling`` to convert higher-level (object) "
"structure into some lower-level serialized \"wire format\". :ref:`The "
"marshalling documentation <http-marshalling-java>` explains this process "
"in detail. This directive simplifies exposing types to clients via a "
"route while providing some form of access to the current context."

"``completeWith`` is similar to ``handleWith``.  The main difference is "
"with ``completeWith`` you must eventually call the completion function "
"generated by ``completeWith``.  ``handleWith`` will automatically call "
"``complete`` when the ``handleWith`` function returns."

"The following example uses ``spray-json`` to marshall a simple ``Person``"
" class to a json response.  It utilizes ``SprayJsonSupport`` via the "
"``PersonJsonSupport`` object as the in-scope unmarshaller."

"The ``findPerson`` takes an argument of type ``Person => Unit`` which is "
