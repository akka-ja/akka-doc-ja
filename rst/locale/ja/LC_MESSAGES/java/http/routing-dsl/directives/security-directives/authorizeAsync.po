"The user-defined authorization check can either be supplied as a ``=> "
"Future[Boolean]`` value which is calculated just from information out of "
"the lexical scope, or as a function ``RequestContext => Future[Boolean]``"
" which can also take information from the request itself into account."

"If the check returns ``true`` or the ``Future`` is failed the request is "
"passed on to the inner route unchanged, otherwise an "
"``AuthorizationFailedRejection`` is created, triggering a ``403 "
"Forbidden`` response by default (the same as in the case of an "
"``AuthenticationFailedRejection``)."

"In a common use-case you would check if a user (e.g. supplied by any of "
"the ``authenticate*`` family of directives, e.g. :ref"
":`-authenticateBasic-java-`) is allowed to access the inner routes, e.g. "
"by checking if the user has the needed permissions."
