"Please note that setting the timeout from within a directive is inherently "
"racy (as the \"point in time from which we're measuring the timeout\" is "
"already in the past (the moment we started handling the request), so if the "
"existing timeout already was triggered before your directive had the chance "
"to change it, an timeout may still be logged."
