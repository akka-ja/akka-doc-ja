"The user-defined authorization check can either be supplied as a ``=> "
"Boolean`` value which is calculated just from information out of the "
"lexical scope, or as a function ``RequestContext => Boolean`` which can "
"also take information from the request itself into account."

"If the check returns ``true`` the request is passed on to the inner route"
" unchanged, otherwise an ``AuthorizationFailedRejection`` is created, "
"triggering a ``403 Forbidden`` response by default (the same as in the "
"case of an ``AuthenticationFailedRejection``)."

"In a common use-case you would check if a user (e.g. supplied by any of "
"the ``authenticate*`` family of directives, e.g. :ref"
":`-authenticateBasic-java-`) is allowed to access the inner routes, e.g. "
"by checking if the user has the needed permissions."
