"A \"Directive\" is a small building block used for creating arbitrarily "

"You could also simply define a \"catch all\" completion by providing it as "

"``get()`` (one of the :ref:`MethodDirectives-java`) to match all incoming "
"``GET`` requests for that route, and all other requests will be routed "
"towards the other \"catch all\" route, that completes the route::"
