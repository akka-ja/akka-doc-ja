"Checks whether the unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` has a prefix "
"matched by the given ``PathMatcher``. Potentially extracts one or more "
"values (depending on the type of the argument) but doesn't consume its "
"match from the unmatched path."

"This directive is very similar to the :ref:`-pathPrefix-java-` directive "
"with the one difference that the path prefix it matched (if it matched) "
"is *not* consumed. The unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` is "
"therefore left as is even in the case that the directive successfully "
"matched and the request is passed on to its inner route."

"As opposed to its :ref:`-pathPrefixTest-java-` counterpart "
"``rawPathPrefixTest`` does *not* automatically add a leading slash to its"
" ``PathMatcher`` argument. Rather its ``PathMatcher`` argument is applied"
" to the unmatched path as is."

"Depending on the type of its ``PathMatcher`` argument the "
"``rawPathPrefixTest`` directive extracts zero or more values from the "
"URI. If the match fails the request is rejected with an :ref:`empty "
