"The :ref:`-headerValue-java-` directive is a mixture of ``map`` and "
"``find`` on the list of request headers. The specified function is called"
" once for each header until the function returns ``Optional(value)``. "
"This value is extracted and presented to the inner route. If the function"
" throws an exception the request is rejected with a "
"``MalformedHeaderRejection``. If the function returns ``Optional.empty`` "
"for every header the request is rejected as \"NotFound\"."
