"The :ref:`-headerValue-java-` directive is a mixture of ``map`` and ``find``"
" on the list of request headers. The specified function is called once for "
"each header until the function returns ``Optional(value)``. This value is "
"extracted and presented to the inner route. If the function throws an "
"exception the request is rejected with a ``MalformedHeaderRejection``. If "
"the function returns ``Optional.empty`` for every header the request is "
"rejected as \"NotFound\"."
