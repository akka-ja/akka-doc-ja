"Exceptions thrown during route execution bubble up through the route "
"structure to the next enclosing :ref:`-handleExceptions-java-` directive or "
"the top of your route structure."

"Similarly to the way that :ref:`rejections-java` are handled the :ref"
":`-handleExceptions-java-` directive delegates the actual job of converting "
"an exception to its argument, an ``ExceptionHandler``."

msgid ""
"An ``ExceptionHandler`` is a partial function, so it can choose which "
"exceptions it would like to handle and which not. Unhandled exceptions will "
"simply continue to bubble up in the route structure. At the root of the "
"route tree any still unhandled exception will be dealt with by the top-level"
" handler which always handles *all* exceptions."

"``Route.seal`` internally wraps its argument route with the :ref"
":`-handleExceptions-java-` directive in order to \"catch\" and handle any "
"exception."

msgid ""
"So, if you'd like to customize the way certain exceptions are handled you "
"need to write a custom ``ExceptionHandler``. Once you have defined your "
"custom ``ExceptionHandler`` you can supply it as argument to the :ref"
":`-handleExceptions-java-` directive. That will apply your handler to the "
"inner route given to that directive."
