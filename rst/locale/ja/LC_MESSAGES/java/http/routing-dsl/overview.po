"The Akka HTTP :ref:`http-low-level-server-side-api-java` provides a "
"``Flow``- or ``Function``-level interface that allows an application to "
"respond to incoming HTTP requests by simply mapping requests to responses "
"(excerpt from :ref:`Low-level server side example <http-low-level-server-"
"side-example-java>`):"

"While it'd be perfectly possible to define a complete REST API service "
"purely by inspecting the incoming ``HttpRequest`` this approach becomes "
"somewhat unwieldy for larger services due to the amount of syntax "
"\"ceremony\" required. Also, it doesn't help in keeping your service "
"definition as DRY_ as you might like."

"As an alternative Akka HTTP provides a flexible DSL for expressing your "
"service behavior as a structure of composable elements (called :ref"
":`directives-java`) in a concise and readable way. Directives are assembled "
"into a so called *route structure* which, at its top-level, can be used to "
"create a handler ``Flow`` (or, alternatively, an async handler function) "
"that can be directly supplied to a ``bind`` call."
