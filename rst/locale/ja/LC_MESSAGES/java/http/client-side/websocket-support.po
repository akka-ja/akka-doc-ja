"A WebSocket consists of two streams of messages, incoming messages (a "
":class:`Sink`) and outgoing messages (a :class:`Source`) where either may"
" be signalled first; or even be the only direction in which messages flow"
" during the lifetime of the connection. Therefore a WebSocket connection "
"is modelled as either something you connect a ``Flow<Message, Message, "
"Mat>`` to or a ``Flow<Message, Message, Mat>`` that you connect a "
"``Source<Message, Mat>`` and a ``Sink<Message, Mat>`` to."

"A WebSocket request starts with a regular HTTP request which contains an "
"``Upgrade`` header (and possibly other regular HTTP request properties), "
"so in addition to the flow of messages there also is an initial response "
"from the server, this is modelled with :class:`WebSocketUpgradeResponse`."

"The methods of the WebSocket client API handle the upgrade to WebSocket "
