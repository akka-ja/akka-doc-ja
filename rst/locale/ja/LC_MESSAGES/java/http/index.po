"The Akka HTTP modules implement a full server- and client-side HTTP stack"
" on top of *akka-actor* and *akka-stream*. It's not a web-framework but "
"rather a more general toolkit for providing and consuming HTTP-based "
"services. While interaction with a browser is of course also in scope it "
"is not the primary focus of Akka HTTP."

"Akka HTTP follows a rather open design and many times offers several "
"different API levels for \"doing the same thing\". You get to pick the "
"API level of abstraction that is most suitable for your application. This"
" means that, if you have trouble achieving something using a high-level "
"API, there's a good chance that you can get it done with a low-level API,"
" which offers more flexibility but might require you to write more "
"application code."
