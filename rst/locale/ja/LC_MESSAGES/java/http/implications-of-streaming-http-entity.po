"Akka HTTP is streaming *all the way through*, which means that the back-"
"pressure mechanisms enabled by Akka Streams are exposed through all "
"layers–from the TCP layer, through the HTTP server, all the way up to the "
"user-facing ``HttpRequest`` and ``HttpResponse`` and their ``HttpEntity`` "
"APIs."

"This has surprising implications if you are used to non-streaming / not-"
"reactive HTTP clients. Specifically it means that: \"*lack of consumption of"
" the HTTP Entity, is signaled as back-pressure to the other side of the "
"connection*\". This is a feature, as it allows one only to consume the "
"entity, and back-pressure servers/clients from overwhelming our application,"
" possibly causing un-necessary buffering of the entity in memory."

"Consuming (or discarding) the Entity of a request is mandatory! If "
"*accidentally* left neither consumed or discarded Akka HTTP will assume the "
"incoming data should remain back-pressured, and will stall the incoming data"
" via TCP back-pressure mechanisms. A client should consume the Entity "
"regardless of the status of the ``HttpResponse``."

"The most common use-case of course is consuming the response entity, which "
"can be done via running the underlying ``dataBytes`` Source. This is as "
"simple as running the dataBytes source, (or on the server-side using "
"directives such as ``BasicDirectives.extractDataBytes``)."

"It is encouraged to use various streaming techniques to utilise the "
"underlying infrastructure to its fullest, for example by framing the "
"incoming chunks, parsing them line-by-line and then connecting the flow into"
" another destination Sink, such as a File or other Akka Streams connector:"

"however sometimes the need may arise to consume the entire entity as "
"``Strict`` entity (which means that it is completely loaded into memory). "
"Akka HTTP provides a special ``toStrict(timeout, materializer)`` method "
"which can be used to eagerly consume the entity and make it available in "
"memory:"

"Sometimes when calling HTTP services we do not care about their response "
"payload (e.g. all we care about is the response code), yet as explained "
"above entity still has to be consumed in some way, otherwise we'll be "
"exherting back-pressure on the underlying TCP connection."

"The ``discardEntityBytes`` convenience method serves the purpose of easily "
"discarding the entity if it has no purpose for us. It does so by piping the "

"Similarily as with the Client-side, HTTP Entities are directly linked to "
"Streams which are fed by the underlying TCP connection. Thus, if request "
"entities remain not consumed, the server will back-pressure the connection, "
"expecting that the user-code will eventually decide what to do with the "
"incoming data."

"Of course you can access the raw dataBytes as well and run the underlying "

"Sometimes, depending on some validation (e.g. checking if given user is "
"allowed to perform uploads or not) you may want to decide to discard the "
"uploaded entity."

"Please note that discarding means that the entire upload will proceed, even "
"though you are not interested in the data being streamed to the server - "
"this may be useful if you are simply not interested in the given entity, "
"however you don't want to abort the entire connection (which we'll "
"demonstrate as well), since there may be more requests pending on the same "
"connection still."

"In order to discard the databytes explicitly you can invoke the "

"A related concept is *cancelling* the incoming ``entity.getDataBytes()`` "
"stream, which results in Akka HTTP *abruptly closing the connection from the"
" Client*. This may be useful when you detect that the given user should not "
"be allowed to make any uploads at all, and you want to drop the connection "
"(instead of reading and ignoring the incoming data). This can be done by "
"attaching the incoming ``entity.getDataBytes()`` to a ``Sink.cancelled`` "
"which will cancel the entity stream, which in turn will cause the underlying"
" connection to be shut-down by the server – effectively hard-aborting the "
"incoming request:"
