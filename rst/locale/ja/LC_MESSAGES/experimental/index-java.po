"The following modules of Akka are marked as experimental, which means that "
"they are in early access mode, which also means that they are not covered by"
" commercial support. The purpose of releasing them early, as experimental, "
"is to make them easily available and improve based on feedback, or even "
"discover that the module wasn't useful."

"An experimental module doesn't have to obey the rule of staying binary "
"compatible between micro releases. Breaking API changes may be introduced in"
" minor releases without notice as we refine and simplify based on your "
"feedback. An experimental module may be dropped in minor releases without "
"prior deprecation."

"Another reason for marking a module as experimental is that it's too early "
"to tell if the module has a maintainer that can take the responsibility of "
"the module over time. These modules live in the ``akka-contrib`` subproject:"
