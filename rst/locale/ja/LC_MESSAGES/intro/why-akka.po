"Akka is a very scalable piece of software, not only in the context of "
"performance but also in the size of applications it is useful for. The core "
"of Akka, akka-actor, is very small and easily dropped into an existing "
"project where you need asynchronicity and lockless concurrency without "
"hassle."

"You can choose to include only the parts of Akka you need in your "
"application. With CPUs growing more and more cores every cycle, Akka is the "
"alternative that provides outstanding performance even if you're only "
"running it on one machine. Akka also supplies a wide array of concurrency-"
"paradigms, allowing users to choose the right tool for the job."
